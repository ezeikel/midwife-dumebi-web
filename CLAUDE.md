# Claude Code Instructions

## Commit Guidelines

- Follow semantic commit convention (feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, style:, refactor:, test:, perf:)
- Keep commit messages as one-liners when possible
- Never include Claude attribution, "Generated with Claude Code", or "Co-Authored-By: Claude" lines
- Write commit messages as if authored by the developer, not AI
